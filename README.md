# Ecommerce-Data-Engineering-Project
This end-to-end e-commerce analytics pipeline in Microsoft Fabric uses a Medallion Architecture. Data from DummyJSON and Mockaroo APIs is cleaned with PySpark, modeled into fact/dimension tables, and enhanced with ML for sales prediction and Hugging Face NLP for product sentiment. Insights are visualized in Power BI dashboards.
